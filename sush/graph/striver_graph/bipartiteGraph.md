A graph will be bipartite if the nodes can be coloured with two colours in such a way that no adjacent nodes should have the same colour.

- A linear graph with no cycle will always be bipartite
- A graph with even numbered node cycle can also be bipartite
- A graph with odd numbered node cycle will not be a bipartite graph
