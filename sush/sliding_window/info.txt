Sliding Window Technique is a method for finding subarrays in an array that satisfy given conditions. 

We do this via maintaining a subset of items as our window, and resize and move that window within the larger list until we find a solution. 

Sliding Window Technique is a subset of Dynamic Programming(breaking a problem into subproblems)
maintaining a subarray that satisfies given set of conditions is our subproblem.


Time complexity = O(n)
Space complexity = O(1)

We can use this technique to find subarrays inside large arrrays, find max/min or common substring
