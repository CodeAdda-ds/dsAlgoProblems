Knapsack means a bag

we cannot fill the bag by more than its capacity

how you fill the bag is defined by knapsack type

a) entire item into the bag

b) multiple instances of item in the bag

c) fractional components in the bag


Knapsack types:

1. 0-1 knapsack: either an instance will be present in the bag or not, i.e. multiple instances are not allowed
total combinations: 2^n 

2. Bounded knapsack: either include an item(multiple instances are allowed but the value should be limiting, not infinity) /exclude an item

3. Unbounded knapsack: no such boundation on the number, can be infinite

Knapsack can also be:

1. Fractional (Greedy) : we can include fractional part of an item

so we calculate rate, i.e. profit/weight and we will go in the decreasing order of profit. we fill the bag with the maximum rate first

2. Integer type: can't pick part of an item

We will be seeing questions of these two categories' combinations:
Most common ones are 

integer + bounded == fractional parts are not allowed + limit on no of instances taken per item
integer + unbounded

Some Knapsack variations:

1. subset sum problem

2. partition equal subset sum

3. count of subsets with sum == x

4. partition a set into 2 subsets such that the difference of subset sum is minimum

5. target sum
